Hi I'm Austin! I'm a Technical Director based in Montreal. I've been working in VFX for a few years as a Lighting and Optimization TD.

My experience is helping Lighting artists with rendering issues and deliver shots in a timely manner. Working with Leads and Supervisors to target problematic issues in the show and resolve them quick to not slow down delivery:

- Building tools and writing scripts for automating tasks
- Render farm errors
- Reducing high memory resource tasks
- Debugging rendering artifacts
- Optimizing shot-based render settings for higher quality final renders


## Software
Nuke, Houdini, Maya, Katana,
Python, RenderMan
