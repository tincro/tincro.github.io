Hi I'm Austin! I'm a Technical Director based in Montreal. I've been working in VFX for a few years as a Lighting and Optimization TD.

My experience is based on helping Lighting artists with rendering related issues and helping them to deliver shots in a timely manner. Working closely with Leads and Supervisors, the goal was to target rendering bottlenecks in the show and help to resolve them quickly to deliver in a timely manner.

Such tasks include:

- Optimizing shot-based render settings for higher quality final renders
- Reducing high memory resource tasks
- Debugging rendering artifacts
- Render farm errors
- Building tools and writing scripts for automating tasks
